            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>And we do farther Certifie, that the Gentlemen appointed to make the Scrutiny on the behalf of Sir <hi>William Prichard</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Tulse,</hi> do make these Objections following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THat several Persons of the <hi>Merchant-Taylors</hi> Company are not duly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to Poll, for that they have not taken the Livery Mans Oath of that Company, entred amongst the By-Laws, Oaths, and Orders of the same.</p>
            <p>Whereunto we have given an Answer to this effect;</p>
            <p>That the Master, Wardens and Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of every Company have power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, set aside, or suspend the Execution and using of their By-Laws, Oaths and Orders as often as they shall think conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient at their own Wills and Pleasures.</p>
            <p>That the first of <hi>October</hi> 1680. the then Master, and Wardens, and Assistants of <hi>Merchant-Taylors</hi> Company did by their Order set aside the Impositions of the Oath before that time usually admitted to such as were Admitted Livery-men of that Company upon their Admission, and that the several Persons last named, were admitted of the Livery of the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany since the making of the said Order last mentioned, all which we are ready to prove.</p>
            <p>They farther make this Objection, That several Persons of the Company of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> have polled, and did not take the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very-Mans Oath entred in their Books, upon their Admission, and therefore have no Legal Vote: Whereunto we have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en this Answer:</p>
            <p>That this Oath is sometimes imposed, and sometimes omitted, according to the pleasure of the Master, Wardens, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:190515:2"/> Assistants, this or the like Oath being no ways essential, for making a Livery-man in any Company in <hi>London;</hi> And if the Masters, Wardens and Assistants, have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Administer the usual Oath, the Livery-men are not to lose their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges or Franchises for the Omission of others; and therefore these Livery-men have Legal Votes; and moreover, We are ready to prove, that all the said Persons but twelve, have taken the said Oath.</p>
            <p>They furthermore have made this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that several persons of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Ʋpholders</hi> who have Polled, are of other Companies, and were not fairly Translated according to the Custom of the City, from being Members of such Companies at the time of their respective Admissions into the <hi>Ʋpholders</hi> Company, and therefore were uncapable of being Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very-men of the same.</p>
            <p>Whereunto we have given this Answer, that any Citizen is capable to be at the same time a Member, and of the Livery of several Companies; and that the Use of Translation from one Company to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is for the ease of such Citizens, he being not liable if once Translated, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Custom, to be put in any chargeable Offices by that Company from whence he is so Translated; and the want of such Translation shall not take away his Right of Polling once, if he was of twenty Companies; and therefore these Persons have Legal Votes.</p>
            <p>They farther object that many Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers who are Freemen of this City and of the Livery, have not Legal Votes, which Assertion as we apprehend is very strange seeing they have not hitherto been disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by any Law whatsoever; which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers of ours we doubt not, will as well satisfie all indifferent and unconcerned persons, as our Selves, that the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons abovementioned, are of no weight or moment; And therefore we do farther Certifie, (not having any farther regard to the said Objections) as followeth.</p>
